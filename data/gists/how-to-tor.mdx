### Install Tor

you can install Tor using the following command

```bash
sudo apt install torbrowser-launcher
```

This package includes everything you need to run a Tor hidden service and to browse them.

If you're running this on a server and don't need the browser, you can install the standalone Tor daemon using the following command

```bash
sudo apt install tor
```

### Config

you need to look for a `torrc` file which will most probably be in the `/etc/tor` directory. open it in an editor. you'll need to use `sudo` because it is a protected file.

```bash
#nano
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

#vim
sudo vim /etc/tor/torrc
```

Look for the following lines.

```bash
############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###

## Once you have configured a hidden service, you can look at the
## contents of the file ".../hidden_service/hostname" for the address
## to tell people.
##
## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect requests on port x to the
## address y:z.

#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
```

you need to uncomment these lines and update accordingly

```ts
HiddenServiceDir "/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/"
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:[PORT]
```

Where `[PORT]` is the port number on which your application is accessible on the localhost.

For this guide, we're going to use a simple directory listing server.

If you have NodeJS installed, you can use the following command to start the server.

```bash
npx serve -l 5000
```

Alternatively, if you have Python 3 installed, you can use the following command to start a python http server.

```bash
python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 5000
```

So our `torrc` file now looks like following

```bash
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Start Tor

Now that everything is configured, you can start the Tor service by using the following command.

```bash
sudo tor
```

Upon starting tor for the first time, a new `.onion` address will be generated for you. you can get the address using the following command

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname
```

If you've changed the `HiddenServiceDir` setting in the `torrc` file, you can find the hostname in `<HiddenServiceDir>/hostname` file.

Anyone can now visit this address using Tor Browser to use your website.
